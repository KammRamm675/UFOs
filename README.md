# UFOs

## SUMMARY

### Drawbacks of the Webpage
 - Although it does bring forward an at-a-glance view of information given in the data.js file, I feel its very limited and not so diverse.  For example, the "dates"entry is pretty dead set on one format.  I feel that the format for the dates (and other parts) should be opened up.  Instead of only accepting "1/1/2010" it should also include 01Jan2010 or Jan 01, 2010. 

### Additional Recommendations
  - Theres a couple of recommendations I feel are needed for this to be even more successful and useful.  One, increase the info in the data.js. It only holds teh month of January.  Pretty sure UFOs are popping around a lot more.  Two, functionality.  It needs to be more user friendly.  Like I brougth up in the first section about drawbacks, information should be flexible.  There shouldnt be just one form of access.  Not everyone (especially internationally) uses the same typing format for dates, location, time, etc etc.
